Join us for a relaxed and friendly evening at your local pub, where SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities) parents and carers can come together, connect, and unwind. Whether you're looking to share experiences, build new friendships, or just enjoy a well-earned break, this is your chance to meet others who truly understand.
